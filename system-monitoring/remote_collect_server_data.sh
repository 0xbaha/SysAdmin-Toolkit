# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# =========================================================================================
# This script automates the process of gathering key system information from a list of
# remote servers defined in a credentials file. It uses SSH and `sshpass` for
# non-interactive login and executes a series of commands on each target server
# to retrieve various metrics. The collected data is aggregated into a single CSV file
# for easy analysis and reporting. It incorporates improved logging, error handling,
# dependency checking, and structured functions based on best practices.
#
# Key Workflow / Functions:
# - Sets Bash Strict Mode (`set -euo pipefail`) for safer execution.
# - Defines global constants and variables for configuration and state.
# - Implements a standardized logging function (`log_message`) with levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, SUCCESS).
# - Implements a dependency check function (`install_if_missing`) that attempts to install `sshpass` and `curl` via `apt` or `yum` if missing.
# - Implements a function (`manage_credentials_file`) to check existence, sort by IP, and enforce 600 permissions on the credentials file (`credentials.txt`).
# - Implements a core function (`execute_remote_commands`) to handle SSH connection and remote execution:
#     - Uses `sshpass` for password authentication (Security Warning: See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS).
#     - Sets SSH connection timeout.
#     - Disables strict host key checking (Security Warning: See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS).
#     - Executes a remote script block (via here-document) on the target server.
#     - The remote script collects: Date, Hostname, OS, Kernel, Uptime, CPU Cores, RAM Usage (%), Disk Usage (%), Private IP (10.x), Public IP, MAC Addresses, Network Interfaces, Default Gateway, DNS Servers, Load Average, Process Count, Swap Usage (%).
#     - Remote script includes basic error handling for individual commands and attempts to clear bash history (best effort).
# - Implements a `cleanup` function (registered with `trap`) to log script exit status.
# - Main execution logic (`main` function):
#     - Checks for root/sudo privileges.
#     - Calls dependency checks.
#     - Manages the credentials file.
#     - Prepares a timestamped output CSV file and writes the header.
#     - Reads `credentials.txt` line by line, skipping empty/commented lines.
#     - Calls `execute_remote_commands` for each server.
#     - Appends results (or error placeholders) to the output CSV.
#     - Logs summary statistics (total processed, success, errors).
# - Includes detailed header documentation covering various aspects of the script.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =========================================================================================
# - **Automation:** Designed for unattended execution to collect data from multiple servers without manual intervention.
# - **Robustness:** Includes Bash Strict Mode, explicit error handling for SSH and file operations, dependency checks, connection timeouts, and permission validation. Uses specific exit codes.
# - **Modularity:** Uses functions for distinct tasks (logging, dependency check, credentials management, remote execution, cleanup).
# - **Readability:** Employs clear variable names (`readonly` for constants), detailed comments, standardized logging (`log_message`), and consistent formatting.
# - **Maintainability:** Structured code with functions and comprehensive header documentation makes updates easier.
# - **Security:** Enforces secure permissions (600) on the credentials file and attempts to clear remote command history. Includes warnings about `sshpass` and `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`.
# - **Simplicity:** Relies on standard Linux commands and avoids overly complex external dependencies where possible for core logic.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PRIMARY AUDIENCE
# =========================================================================================
# - System Administrators
# - DevOps Engineers
# - IT Support Teams managing multiple Linux servers requiring periodic metric collection.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# USAGE
# =========================================================================================
# **Permissions:**
# - Script execution: `chmod +x remote_collect_server_data.sh`
# - File system access: Read access to `credentials.txt`. Write access to the script's directory to create the output CSV file. Write access potentially needed by `apt`/`yum` cache during dependency install.
# - Elevated privileges: Requires `sudo` or root privileges. This is primarily needed for the `install_if_missing` function to use `apt` or `yum` for installing `sshpass` and `curl` if they are not found. If dependencies are guaranteed to be present, the script *might* run without sudo if the executing user has appropriate SSH permissions and file access, but the initial check enforces sudo/root.
#
# **Prerequisites:**
# - Create a credentials file named `credentials.txt` in the same directory as the script (`${SCRIPT_DIR}/credentials.txt`).
# - Format `credentials.txt` with one server per line, space-separated: `server_ip port username password`
#   Example:
#   ```
# This is a comment line, it will be ignored
#   192.168.1.10 22 root mypassword123
#   10.20.30.40 2222 admin pa$$w0rd
#   ```
# - Ensure the user running the script (likely root via sudo) has network access to the target servers on the specified SSH ports.
#
# **Basic Syntax:**
# `sudo ./remote_collect_server_data.sh`
#
# **Options:**
# - This script does not currently support command-line options (e.g., -h, -v, -c). It uses hardcoded paths relative to the script's location for the credentials file and output directory.
#
# **Arguments:**
# - None. Relies solely on the `credentials.txt` file found in the script's directory.
#
# **Common Examples:**
# 1. Basic execution (requires `credentials.txt` in the same directory):
#    `sudo ./remote_collect_server_data.sh`
#
# **Advanced Execution (Automation):**
# - Example cron job running daily at 2:15 AM, logging standard output/error:
#   `15 2 * * * cd /path/to/script/directory && sudo ./remote_collect_server_data.sh >> /var/log/remote_collect.log 2>&1`
#   (Ensure the user running cron has sudo privileges without a password prompt for this specific script, or configure cron differently).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# INSTALLATION / DEPLOYMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Recommended Location:**
# - Secure directory accessible by the intended execution user/process (e.g., `/usr/local/sbin/` if run by root, `/opt/scripts/`, or a dedicated service user's directory).
# - Ensure the script file has appropriate ownership (e.g., `chown root:root`) and permissions (e.g., `chmod 700` or `750`).
#
# **Manual Setup:**
# 1. Place the script (`remote_collect_server_data.sh`) in the chosen location.
# 2. Set appropriate ownership and executable permissions (e.g., `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/remote_collect_server_data.sh && sudo chmod 700 /usr/local/sbin/remote_collect_server_data.sh`).
# 3. Create the `credentials.txt` file in the same directory, populating it with server details.
# 4. Set strict permissions on the credentials file: `sudo chmod 600 /path/to/script/directory/credentials.txt`. The script also attempts to enforce this.
# 5. Ensure required dependencies (`sshpass`, `curl`) are installed. The script attempts to install them via `apt` or `yum` if run with `sudo`, but manual pre-installation might be preferred.
# 6. Test run the script interactively: `sudo /path/to/script/directory/remote_collect_server_data.sh`.
#
# **Integration (Optional):**
# - **Cron Job:** See USAGE section. Ensure correct paths and permissions. Consider user context for cron execution.
# - **Systemd Service:** Could be adapted to run as a systemd service/timer for more robust scheduling and management. Would require creating `.service` and `.timer` unit files.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Required Interpreter:**
# - `/bin/bash`: Assumes Bash version 4+ for features like `declare -A` (associative arrays in logging) and robust `[[ ... ]]` usage. Uses `#!/bin/bash`.
#
# **Required Binaries/Tools (on the machine running the script):**
# - `bash`: The shell interpreter.
# - `coreutils`: Provides `date`, `basename`, `dirname`, `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `stat`, `rm`.
# - `grep`: For pattern matching.
# - `awk`: For text processing.
# - `sed`: For stream editing.
# - `sort`: For sorting the credentials file.
# - `command`: Bash built-in for checking command existence.
# - `ssh`: The OpenSSH client.
# - `sshpass`: **Required** for non-interactive SSH password authentication. (Security Warning: See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS).
# - `curl`: **Required** for checking dependencies (via package manager interaction simulation in function) and used remotely.
# - `apt` / `apt-get` (Debian/Ubuntu) OR `yum`/`dnf` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora): **Required** package manager if `sshpass` or `curl` need to be installed automatically (requires `sudo`).
#
# **Required Binaries/Tools (on the remote target servers):**
# - `bash`: To execute the remote script block.
# - `coreutils`: `date`, `hostname`, `cat`, `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `df`, `uname`, `uptime`, `ps`, `wc`, `paste`, `sed`, `echo`, `rm` (for history clearing).
# - `ip` (from `iproute2` package): To get IP addresses, MAC addresses, network interfaces, default gateway.
# - `curl`: To fetch the public IP address from an external service (`ifconfig.io`). Requires internet access from the remote server.
# - `free` (from `procps` or similar package): To get RAM and Swap usage.
# - `history`: Bash built-in used to clear command history.
#
# **Setup Instructions (if dependencies are not standard):**
# - The script attempts auto-installation of `sshpass` and `curl` on the local machine using `sudo apt` or `sudo yum`.
# - Manual installation (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y sshpass curl iproute2 procps`
# - Manual installation (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora): `sudo yum update && sudo yum install -y sshpass curl iproute2 procps-ng` (Note: `sshpass` might be in the EPEL repository: `sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install sshpass`)
#
# **Operating System Compatibility:**
# - Local Script Execution: Designed primarily for Linux distributions with `bash`, `apt` or `yum` package managers (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora).
# - Remote Target Servers: Assumes common Linux distributions where the listed "Required Binaries/Tools (on the remote target servers)" are available in standard paths. Commands like `ip`, `free`, `df`, `/etc/os-release`, `/proc/cpuinfo` are common but minor variations might exist.
#
# **Environment Variables Used:**
# - `EUID`: Used to check for root/sudo privileges.
# - `PATH`: Standard variable, assumed to contain paths to all required binaries.
# - `HOME`: Implicitly used by SSH and for `~/.bash_history` path resolution on remote servers.
#
# **System Resource Requirements:**
# - Local: Minimal CPU/RAM usage. Disk space needed for the script, credentials file, and the output CSV (size depends on number of servers and retention). Network bandwidth for SSH connections.
# - Remote: Minimal impact. Executes standard system query commands. `curl ifconfig.io` requires a small amount of network traffic.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# LOGGING MECHANISM
# =========================================================================================
# **Log Destination(s):**
# - Standard Output (stdout): INFO, SUCCESS, DEBUG messages (DEBUG only shown implicitly by `set -x` if enabled, not via `log_message`).
# - Standard Error (stderr): WARN, ERROR messages. Used by the `log_message` function for these levels. SSH errors also typically go to stderr.
# - Dedicated Log File: No. Logging goes directly to stdout/stderr. Can be redirected using shell redirection (e.g., `>> /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1`).
#
# **Log Format:**
# - Uses the `log_message` function format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] - Message`
# - Example: `[2025-04-20 17:01:00] [INFO] - Starting script: remote_collect_server_data.sh`
#
# **Log Levels (Implemented via `log_message`):**
# - `INFO`: General operational steps.
# - `WARN`: Potential issues or non-critical failures (e.g., remote command errors).
# - `ERROR`: Significant errors that likely impede data collection or script function (e.g., failed SSH, missing files, permission errors). Script may continue or exit depending on the error.
# - `SUCCESS`: Confirmation of successful operations (e.g., dependency install, data collection per server).
# - No `DEBUG` or `CRITICAL` levels explicitly used in current `log_message` calls, but the function supports them conceptually. `set -x` can be used for debug tracing.
#
# **Log Rotation:**
# - Not applicable as the script does not manage its own log file. If output is redirected, use external tools like `logrotate` for the target file.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =========================================================================================
# **Standard Output (stdout):**
# - `INFO` and `SUCCESS` messages from the `log_message` function.
# - Examples: Status updates on dependency checks, file management, starting collection per server, successful collection, final summary.
#
# **Standard Error (stderr):**
# - `WARN` and `ERROR` messages from the `log_message` function.
# - Examples: Privilege errors, missing files, dependency install failures, permission errors, SSH connection failures, remote command errors, failure summaries.
# - Output from `set -x` if debug mode is manually enabled.
#
# **Generated/Modified Files:**
# - `credentials.txt`: Read by the script. Sorted in-place using `sort -o`. Permissions checked and potentially set to 600.
# - `server_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: Created in the script's directory (`${SCRIPT_DIR}`). Contains the collected data. Overwrites if a file with the exact same timestamp name somehow exists (unlikely).
#   - Columns: `Server,Date,Hostname,OS,Kernel Version,Uptime,CPU Cores,RAM Usage,Disk Usage,Private IP,Public IP,MAC Address,Network Interfaces,Default Gateway,DNS Servers,Load Average,Processes,Swap Usage`
#   - Rows with errors during collection for a specific server will contain `ERROR_COLLECTING_DATA` in the second column and likely empty/N/A values after.
# - Temporary Files: None explicitly created by the script logic itself (uses pipes and variables). Standard tools (`ssh`, `sort`) might use system temporary space internally.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ERROR HANDLING & CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# **Exit Codes:**
# - 0: Success - Script completed. Note: This can still occur if individual server collections failed but the script itself ran through the list. Check the final summary log messages and the CSV content for per-server success.
# - 1: General Error / Privilege Error - Script not run as root/sudo. SSH/remote command failure for a server (`execute_remote_commands` returns 1, logged but doesn't stop the loop). No data returned from successful SSH.
# - 2: Dependency Error - Required command (`sshpass`, `curl`) not found and installation failed or package manager unsupported.
# - 3: Configuration Error - `credentials.txt` file not found.
# - 5: Permission Error - Failed to set required permissions (600) on `credentials.txt`.
# - 6: File System Error - Failed to sort `credentials.txt`, failed to write header or append data to the output CSV.
# - Other non-zero codes: May originate from commands failing when `set -e` is active, if not explicitly handled.
#
# **Potential Issues & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Issue:** "ERROR: This script requires root or sudo privileges..."
#   **Resolution:** Run the script using `sudo ./remote_collect_server_data.sh`.
# - **Issue:** "ERROR: Credentials file does not exist..."
#   **Resolution:** Ensure `credentials.txt` exists in the same directory as the script and is readable.
# - **Issue:** "ERROR: Failed to install sshpass..." or "Unsupported package manager..."
#   **Resolution:** Manually install `sshpass` and `curl` using the appropriate package manager for your distribution. Ensure `sudo` works correctly.
# - **Issue:** "ERROR: SSH connection or remote command execution failed..." (Exit Code != 0)
#   **Resolution:** Verify IP, port, username, password in `credentials.txt`. Check network connectivity (ping, traceroute) and firewalls. Ensure SSH service is running on the remote server. Check remote user permissions. Increase `ConnectTimeout=10` in `execute_remote_commands` if network latency is high. Test SSH manually: `ssh -p <port> <username>@<server_ip>`.
# - **Issue:** "WARN: Encountered errors during remote data collection..." or missing/N/A fields in CSV.
#   **Resolution:** Connect manually via SSH to the affected server (`ssh -p <port> <username>@<server_ip>`) and execute the commands from the `END_REMOTE_SCRIPT` block individually to see which one fails. Check if required remote tools are installed and if the output format matches expectations (e.g., `ip a`, `df -h`, `free`). `curl ifconfig.io` requires internet access from the remote server. `/etc/os-release` or `/proc/cpuinfo` might be missing or different.
# - **Issue:** Script hangs.
#   **Resolution:** Most likely an SSH connection issue. Check credentials, network, firewalls. Ensure `sshpass` isn't stuck waiting for unexpected input. Test SSH manually.
#
# **Important Considerations / Warnings:**
# - **Credentials Security:** Passwords are read from plain text `credentials.txt`. This is highly insecure. **Use SSH key-based authentication instead whenever possible.** If passwords must be used via `sshpass`, ensure `credentials.txt` has strict 600 permissions (enforced by script) and the file/system access is tightly controlled. Passwords might be briefly visible in the process list (`ps`).
# - **StrictHostKeyChecking=no:** This SSH option disables host key verification, making connections vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. **This is a significant security risk, especially in untrusted networks.** For production use, remove this option and manage `known_hosts` properly (e.g., pre-populate keys using `ssh-keyscan` in a secure manner, or use configuration management).
# - **History Clearing:** The remote script attempts to clear `~/.bash_history`. This is a basic measure and not foolproof. System-level auditing (e.g., `auditd`) might still log commands. It primarily affects interactive shell history retrieval.
# - **Sequential Execution:** The script processes servers one by one. For a large number of servers, this can be time-consuming. Consider parallelization (e.g., using `xargs -P`, `GNU parallel`, or background processes with `wait`) for faster execution, but be mindful of local resource limits and potential network impact.
# - **Error Reporting:** The script logs errors but continues processing other servers by default. A failure for one server doesn't stop the whole process. The final exit code is 0 if the script completes the loop, even with individual server errors. Review logs and CSV output for per-server status.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ASSUMPTIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - Assumes `credentials.txt` exists in the script's directory and is formatted correctly (`ip port user pass`).
# - Assumes password-based SSH authentication is enabled and permitted on remote servers for the specified users/ports.
# - Assumes the machine running the script has reliable network connectivity to all target servers on their specified SSH ports.
# - Assumes remote servers are Linux-based and have the required standard utilities (bash, coreutils, iproute2, procps, curl, etc.) installed in standard `$PATH` locations.
# - Assumes remote servers have internet access for `curl ifconfig.io` to fetch public IPs.
# - Assumes the script is run with `sudo` or as root to handle potential dependency installations.
# - Assumes primary private IPs on remote servers match the `10.20.*` or `10.31.*` pattern for extraction via `grep -Eo`.
# - Assumes the `sort` command supports the `-t '.' -k<pos>,<pos>n` syntax for IP sorting.
# - Assumes `stat -c %a` works for checking file permissions in octal.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Optional - Fill if relevant)
# =========================================================================================
# **Benchmarks:** Not formally benchmarked. Execution time is primarily dependent on the number of servers, network latency, and SSH connection establishment time per server.
# **Resource Consumption Profile:** Low CPU/Memory locally. Network usage proportional to number of servers * (SSH overhead + small command output).
# **Optimization Notes:**
# - Currently executes sequentially. Parallel execution (e.g., using background jobs, `xargs -P`, or `GNU parallel`) could significantly speed up collection for many servers but would increase local resource usage and concurrent network connections.
# - Remote script combines multiple commands; further optimization by reducing forks or using more efficient text processing might be possible but likely negligible impact compared to network/SSH time.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# TESTING & VALIDATION (Optional - Describe testing efforts)
# =========================================================================================
# **Test Strategy:** Primarily manual testing against various Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) as remote targets.
# **Key Test Cases Covered:**
# - Handles missing `credentials.txt`.
# - Handles incorrect permissions on `credentials.txt` (sets to 600).
# - Sorts `credentials.txt` correctly by IP.
# - Handles missing dependencies (`sshpass`, `curl`) by attempting installation (requires sudo).
# - Handles SSH connection failures (wrong password, wrong port, timeout) and logs errors.
# - Handles errors within the remote script execution (e.g., command not found, permission denied for remote command) and logs warnings.
# - Correctly parses and formats data into the CSV output file.
# - Handles empty or commented lines in `credentials.txt`.
# - Exit codes reflect critical script failures (e.g., missing file, dependency failure).
# **Validation Environment:** Tested manually on Ubuntu 22.04 (local) against Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and CentOS 7/Stream 9 (remote).
# **Automation:** Static analysis performed using ShellCheck. No automated unit/integration tests currently implemented.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# FUTURE ROADMAP / POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
# =========================================================================================
# - [Feature] Add command-line options (using `getopts` or `getopt`) for:
#   - Specifying credentials file path (`-c`).
#   - Specifying output file/directory path (`-o`).
#   - Enabling verbose/debug logging (`-v`).
#   - Help message (`-h`).
# - [Feature] Add support for SSH key-based authentication (preferred over passwords). Might require options to specify key file path.
# - [Improvement] Implement parallel execution (e.g., using background processes with `wait` or `GNU parallel`) to speed up collection for large numbers of servers. Add an option to control concurrency level (`-P`).
# - [Improvement] Enhance remote error handling: capture stderr from remote commands more effectively to provide specific error details in logs.
# - [Improvement] Make the private IP address pattern (`10.20.*|10.31.*`) configurable via variable or option.
# - [Security] Remove `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` and provide guidance or options for managing `known_hosts`.
# - [Compatibility] Test and potentially add workarounds for wider OS compatibility (e.g., macOS, different Linux distros).
# - [Feature] Add option for different output formats (e.g., JSON).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - **Privilege Level:** Requires root/sudo for dependency installation. If deps are met, could potentially run as non-root if that user has SSH access and file permissions, but the script enforces a root check currently. Running as root minimizes permission issues but increases risk if the script is compromised.
# - **Input Sanitization:** Reads server details directly from `credentials.txt`. Assumes format is correct. Malformed lines might cause `read` or `ssh`/`sshpass` to fail for that line. Does not explicitly sanitize hostname/IP, username, or password beyond shell interpretation. Passwords containing shell metacharacters might cause issues with `sshpass -p`.
# - **Sensitive Data Handling:** **[CRITICAL WARNING]** Reads passwords from the plain text `credentials.txt` file and passes them to `sshpass -p`. This exposes passwords in the script file and potentially in the system's process list (`ps`). **THIS IS HIGHLY INSECURE.** Use SSH key-based authentication instead whenever possible. The script enforces 600 permissions on `credentials.txt` as a minimal mitigation.
# - **Dependencies:** Relies on standard system tools (`bash`, `ssh`, `curl`, `coreutils`, etc.) and `sshpass`. Ensure these are from trusted sources and updated. `sshpass` inherently handles passwords insecurely compared to SSH keys.
# - **File Permissions:** Enforces 600 on `credentials.txt`. Output CSV file is created with default umask permissions (likely 644 or 664 depending on system). Temporary files are not explicitly created.
# - **Remote Execution:** Executes a predefined script block on remote systems via SSH. Ensure the script file itself is secured against unauthorized modification.
# - **History Clearing:** The remote `history -c` and file overwrite attempt is a basic measure and may not erase all execution traces, depending on remote system logging/auditing configuration.
# - **StrictHostKeyChecking=no:** **[SECURITY RISK]** Disables SSH host key verification, making connections vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Remove this for production environments and manage host keys properly.
