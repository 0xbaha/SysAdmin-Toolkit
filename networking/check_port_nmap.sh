# VERSION       : 1.0.0
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# =========================================================================================
# This script uses nmap's full TCP connection scan (`-sT`). It reads a list of server IP
# addresses from a file, checks a predefined set of common network ports on each IP,
# and generates two timestamped CSV output files:
#
# 1. Detailed Results: A CSV file listing each checked port for each IP,
#    including timestamp, IP address, port number, and its status (OPEN or CLOSED).
#    Filename: server_check_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
#
# 2. Summary Report: A CSV file indicating the overall status of each IP address,
#    marked as "Active" if at least one common port was found open, or "Inactive"
#    if none of the checked ports were open.
#    Filename: server_check_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
#
# The script includes a configurable random delay between scanning hosts to minimize
# network impact and potential detection. It also sorts and deduplicates the input
# IP list file (`list_server_ip.txt`) in place.
#
# Key Workflow / Functions:
# - Uses Bash strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`) and traps for cleanup.
# - Defines script metadata, constants, and runtime variables.
# - Implements structured logging with levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL, DEBUG).
# - Provides a usage function (`-h`).
# - Checks for required dependencies (`nmap`, `sort`, `date`, `grep`, `xargs`).
# - Parses command-line arguments (currently only `-h`).
# - Validates the existence and readability of the input IP list file.
# - Sorts and deduplicates the input IP list file (`list_server_ip.txt`).
# - Creates output directory and checks writability.
# - Initializes output CSV files with headers.
# - Iterates through each unique, valid IP address from the input file.
# - Performs an nmap TCP connect scan (`-sT -n -Pn`) for specified common ports.
# - Parses nmap output to identify open ports.
# - Records the status (OPEN/CLOSED) of each checked port for every IP in the detailed CSV file.
# - Determines if an IP is "Active" (at least one specified port open) or "Inactive".
# - Records the overall activity status of each IP in the summary CSV file.
# - Introduces a random sleep interval between scanning hosts.
# - Provides informative log messages throughout execution.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =========================================================================================
# - **Simplicity:** Focuses on the core task of port checking with clear inputs and outputs.
# - **Robustness:** Includes checks for dependencies, input file validity, IP format (basic), directory writability, and basic error handling during execution (e.g., nmap failures, file write failures). Uses `set -euo pipefail` and traps.
# - **Automation:** Designed for easy execution, requiring only the IP list file. Timestamped outputs prevent overwriting.
# - **Clarity:** Generates structured CSV reports. Uses a logging function for consistent, leveled output.
# - **Readability:** Employs clear variable names, comments, structured functions, and consistent formatting based on the referenced template.
# - **Consideration:** Implements a random delay between scans to be less aggressive on target networks and avoid potential blocking.
# - **Modularity:** Uses functions for distinct tasks (logging, usage, dependency check, validation, preparation, port checking, main logic, cleanup).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PRIMARY AUDIENCE
# =========================================================================================
# - System Administrators
# - Network Engineers
# - Security Analysts (for basic reconnaissance or verification)
# - IT Support Teams needing basic network service reachability checks.
# - DevOps Engineers monitoring service availability.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# USAGE
# =========================================================================================
# **Permissions:**
# - Script execution: `chmod +x check_port_nmap.sh`
# - File system access: Read access to `list_server_ip.txt`. Write access to `list_server_ip.txt` (for sorting) and the output directory (default: script directory) for CSV files and potentially logs.
# - Network access: Outbound connections to target IPs on specified ports.
# - Elevated privileges: `nmap -sT` might require root/sudo privileges for optimal results or to function correctly, depending on the OS and network configuration (raw socket access). Test without sudo first. If needed, run as `sudo ./check_port_nmap.sh`. *Justification: nmap's connect scan might need root for certain OS network stack interactions or if run with other options requiring privileges.*
#
# **Basic Syntax:**
#   `./check_port_nmap.sh`
#   (Assumes `list_server_ip.txt` exists in the same directory)
#
#   `sudo ./check_port_nmap.sh`
#   (If root privileges are required for nmap)
#
# **Options:**
#   -h          Display this help message and exit.
#   [Currently, no other options are implemented. Configuration is via variables or the input file.]
#
# **Arguments:**
#   [This script currently does not accept positional arguments.]
#
# **Preparation:**
# 1. Ensure `nmap`, `coreutils` (`date`, `sort`), `grep`, and `findutils` (`xargs`) are installed.
# 2. Create a text file named `list_server_ip.txt` (or modify `IP_LIST_DEFAULT` variable) in the script's directory.
# 3. Populate `list_server_ip.txt` with target IP addresses, one per line. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
#    Example `list_server_ip.txt`:
#    ```
# Production Web Servers
#    192.168.1.1
#    192.168.1.2
# Database Server
#    10.0.0.5
# 192.168.1.1 # Duplicates will be removed automatically
#    8.8.8.8     # External check
#    invalid-entry # This will be skipped with a warning
#    ```
#
# **Output:**
# - The script will create two CSV files in the output directory (default: script directory):
#   - `server_check_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (detailed port status)
#   - `server_check_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (overall IP activity: Active/Inactive)
# - Status messages, warnings, and errors are printed to stdout/stderr based on log level.
#
# **Automation Example (Cron):**
# - Run daily at 3:30 AM, logging to a dedicated file in `/var/log`:
#   `30 3 * * * /path/to/check_port_nmap.sh >> /var/log/port_check.log 2>&1`
#   (Ensure the user running cron has permissions and necessary environment variables like PATH if needed, or use full paths in the script/cron job). Consider using the script's file logging if more structure is needed.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# INSTALLATION / DEPLOYMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Recommended Location:**
# - User scripts: `~/bin/` or `~/.local/bin/` (if in user's $PATH)
# - System-wide utility: `/usr/local/bin/` or `/opt/scripts/`
#
# **Manual Setup:**
# 1. Place the script in the chosen location.
# 2. Set appropriate ownership (e.g., `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/check_port_nmap.sh` if system-wide).
# 3. Set executable permissions (e.g., `chmod +x check_port_nmap.sh` or `sudo chmod 755 ...` for system-wide).
# 4. Install required dependencies (see DEPENDENCIES section).
# 5. Create the `list_server_ip.txt` file (or configure `IP_LIST_DEFAULT`) in the script's directory and populate it.
# 6. Ensure the directory is writable for output files and the `list_server_ip.txt` file itself (for sorting).
# 7. Run the script with `-h` to verify basic execution.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Required Interpreter:**
# - `/bin/bash`: Bourne-Again SHell (Version >= 4.0 recommended for features like mapfile and associative arrays used in logging).
#
# **Required System Binaries/Tools:**
# - `nmap`: Core utility for network scanning. (Version requirement not strict for `-sT`). Purpose: Port scanning.
# - `coreutils`: Provides `date` (timestamping), `sort` (IP list processing), `mkdir`, `basename`, `dirname`. Purpose: Basic file/system operations.
# - `grep`: For pattern searching (used in port checking logic and dependency checks). Purpose: Text pattern matching.
# - `findutils`: Provides `xargs` (used for trimming whitespace from IPs). Purpose: Build and execute command lines from standard input.
# - `command`: Bash built-in. Purpose: Check command existence.
# - `getopts`: Bash built-in. Purpose: Parse command-line options.
#
# **Setup Instructions (if dependencies are not standard):**
# - Debian/Ubuntu:
#   `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap coreutils grep findutils`
# - CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
#   `sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install -y nmap coreutils grep findutils`
#   (or `yum` for older RHEL/CentOS versions)
#
# **Operating System Compatibility:**
# - Designed primarily for: Linux distributions (tested lightly on Ubuntu/Debian derivatives).
# - Known compatibility issues: macOS might require installing `coreutils` (for `gdate`, `gsort`) and potentially adjusting flags if BSD versions differ significantly. Untested on Windows (WSL recommended).
#
# **Environment Variables Used:**
# - None directly used by the script logic (relies on standard PATH).
#
# **System Resource Requirements:**
# - CPU: Low, brief spikes during nmap execution for each host.
# - Memory: Low, typically well under 100MB RAM.
# - Disk I/O: Minimal, for reading `list_server_ip.txt`, modifying it in place, and writing relatively small CSV output files.
# - Network: Outbound traffic depends on the number of IPs and ports scanned. The `sleep` interval significantly reduces concurrent network load.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# LOGGING MECHANISM
# =========================================================================================
# **Log Destination(s):**
# - Standard Output (stdout): INFO and DEBUG messages (DEBUG only if `VERBOSE=true`, which is currently hardcoded to false).
# - Standard Error (stderr): WARN, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages. Help message (`-h`).
# - Dedicated Log File: No, this script does not implement logging to a dedicated file by default. All output goes to stdout/stderr.
# - System Log (syslog/journald): No.
#
# **Log Format:**
# - Console Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ] [LEVEL] - Message` (Colored if interactive terminal).
#
# **Log Levels (Implemented):**
# - `DEBUG`: Detailed step tracing (currently suppressed unless `VERBOSE` flag is enabled and used).
# - `INFO`: General operational messages (start, finish, processing IP).
# - `WARN`: Potential issues or non-critical errors (invalid IP format, nmap failure for one IP).
# - `ERROR`: Significant errors affecting a specific operation (failed to write to output file).
# - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors causing script termination (missing dependency, unwritable directory, critical file error).
# - Control: Log level filtering is basic; WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL always shown, INFO/DEBUG conditionally. `LOG_LEVEL` variable exists but primarily controls numeric comparison logic within `log_message`.
#
# **Log Rotation:**
# - Not applicable as dedicated file logging is not implemented. External redirection (`>> file.log`) would require external rotation (e.g., `logrotate`).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =========================================================================================
# **Standard Output (stdout):**
# - Normal Operation: Prints INFO messages like "Starting main script execution...", "Processing IP address: X.X.X.X", "IP X.X.X.X status: Active/Inactive", "Script completed successfully.".
# - Debug Output: If enabled, prints DEBUG messages like "Executing nmap command...", "Sleeping for N seconds...".
#
# **Standard Error (stderr):**
# - Errors: Prints CRITICAL/ERROR messages like "CRITICAL: Required command 'nmap' not found.", "ERROR: Failed to write detailed result for X.X.X.X:PORT...".
# - Warnings: Prints WARN messages like "WARN: Invalid IP address format found...", "WARN: Nmap command failed... for IP: X.X.X.X".
# - Help Message: Output of `usage()` function when `-h` is used.
#
# **Generated/Modified Files:**
# - `server_check_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (Creates): Contains detailed results. Columns: Timestamp, IP Address, Port, Status (OPEN/CLOSED). Located in `OUTPUT_DIR`.
# - `server_check_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (Creates): Contains summary results. Columns: IP Address, Status (Active/Inactive). Located in `OUTPUT_DIR`.
# - `list_server_ip.txt` (Modifies): This file is **sorted and deduplicated in place**. Ensure you have a backup if the original order or duplicate entries are important.
# - Temporary Files: None explicitly created or managed by the script (nmap might use temporary resources internally).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ERROR HANDLING & CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# **Exit Codes:**
# - 0: Success. Script completed without critical errors. Warnings or non-critical errors (like skipping one invalid IP) might have occurred.
# - 1: General/Critical Error. Used by `log_message CRITICAL` for fatal issues like missing dependencies, file system errors, unwritable directories, critical file processing failures. Also used by `usage` function.
# - Non-zero exit codes from commands within the main loop (e.g., `echo >> file`) might cause immediate exit due to `set -e` if not handled (current implementation includes basic error checks for file writes).
#
# **Potential Issues & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Issue:** "CRITICAL: Required command 'nmap' not found."
#   **Resolution:** Install nmap (see DEPENDENCIES). Ensure it's in the PATH accessible by the user running the script.
# - **Issue:** "CRITICAL: Input file 'list_server_ip.txt' not found..." or "...not readable."
#   **Resolution:** Create `list_server_ip.txt` in the script's directory (or where `IP_LIST` points). Check permissions (`ls -l`). Ensure the script is run from the correct directory.
# - **Issue:** "CRITICAL: Failed to sort the IP list file..."
#   **Resolution:** Check write permissions on `list_server_ip.txt` and the directory containing it. Check disk space.
# - **Issue:** "CRITICAL: Output directory '...' could not be created." or "...not writable."
#   **Resolution:** Check permissions for the user running the script in the parent directory (to create) or the directory itself (to write). Check disk space.
# - **Issue:** "WARN: Invalid IP address format..."
#   **Resolution:** Correct the specified line in `list_server_ip.txt`. The script uses a basic regex and skips invalid lines.
# - **Issue:** Ports show as CLOSED/Filtered when they should be OPEN.
#   **Resolution:** Check firewalls (host-based: iptables, firewalld, ufw; network firewalls). Verify the service is running on the target. Ensure `nmap -sT -Pn` isn't blocked. Running as root/sudo might yield different results. Nmap might report filtered instead of closed if blocked by firewall.
# - **Issue:** "WARN: Nmap command failed or returned non-zero status..."
#   **Resolution:** Indicates nmap had trouble scanning that specific IP. Could be network issues, host being down (despite -Pn), or nmap internal errors. Check connectivity manually. The script skips port checking for this IP.
# - **Issue:** Script runs very slowly.
#   **Resolution:** The `sleep $((RANDOM % 10 + 5))` introduces a 5-14 second delay per host. Adjust this line in the `main` function if faster scanning is needed and acceptable for the target network/systems.
#
# **Important Considerations / Warnings:**
# - **[Scan Detection]:** TCP connect scans (`-sT`) are easily detected and logged by firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS/IPS). **Ensure you have explicit permission** to scan the target systems. Unauthorized scanning can have serious consequences.
# - **[Resource Usage]:** While generally low impact per host due to the delay, scanning a very large list of IPs can still consume considerable time and generate noticeable network traffic over the duration.
# - **[Accuracy]:** Network conditions (latency, packet loss) or firewall rules (filtering/blocking) can affect scan accuracy. A 'CLOSED' status usually means the port responded as closed, but could potentially mean 'filtered' or 'unreachable' if nmap cannot determine definitively due to network issues or aggressive filtering. The script simplifies this to OPEN/CLOSED based on nmap's `--open` flag output for `-sT`.
# - **[IP Sorting - Data Modification]:** The script **modifies `list_server_ip.txt` in place** to sort and deduplicate entries. **Keep a backup** if the original order or presence of duplicates is important.
# - **[Privilege Requirement]:** `nmap -sT` may require root/sudo. Running scripts with elevated privileges should be done cautiously.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ASSUMPTIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - The `list_server_ip.txt` file (or the file specified by `IP_LIST`) exists relative to the script's directory or is specified correctly.
# - The script has read permissions for the IP list file and write permissions for both the IP list file (for sorting) and the output directory.
# - Required dependencies (`bash`, `nmap`, `coreutils`, `grep`, `findutils`) are installed and accessible via the system's `$PATH`.
# - Network connectivity exists between the host running the script and the target IP addresses on the ports being checked.
# - The user running the script has the necessary network permissions to perform outbound TCP connection attempts to the target IPs/ports. Root/sudo might be needed for nmap.
# - The input IP list file contains one IP address per line (or comments/blank lines). Basic validation is done, but highly malformed lines might cause issues.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
# =========================================================================================
# **Benchmarks:** Not formally benchmarked. Performance is largely dependent on network latency, the number of IPs, and the mandatory `sleep` interval.
# **Resource Consumption Profile:** Generally low (see DEPENDENCIES).
# **Optimization Notes:**
# - The primary performance control is the `sleep` duration between hosts. Reducing this speeds up the script but increases scan aggressiveness.
# - Nmap's `-T3` timing template is used as a balance. Faster templates (`-T4`, `-T5`) could be used but increase detection risk and potential network load.
# - `-n` (no DNS resolution) and `-Pn` (skip ping discovery) are used to speed up scans when assuming hosts are online and DNS is not needed for IPs.
# - Parsing nmap output uses basic Bash regex and array processing, generally efficient for this scale.
# - Parallel execution is *not* implemented to avoid overwhelming target networks and simplify the script.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# TESTING & VALIDATION
# =========================================================================================
# **Test Strategy:** Manual testing during development. No automated unit/integration tests (e.g., Bats, shunit2) included.
# **Key Test Cases Covered (Manual):**
# - Handles missing `list_server_ip.txt` file.
# - Handles empty `list_server_ip.txt` file (generates empty reports).
# - Handles missing dependencies (nmap, sort, etc.).
# - Correctly parses `-h` argument.
# - Ignores comments and blank lines in `list_server_ip.txt`.
# - Skips and warns about invalid IP formats in `list_server_ip.txt`.
# - Correctly sorts and deduplicates `list_server_ip.txt`.
# - Creates output CSV files with correct headers.
# - Correctly identifies OPEN and CLOSED ports based on nmap output for reachable IPs.
# - Correctly identifies Active/Inactive status in summary report.
# - Handles nmap command failure for a specific IP (logs warning, marks ports as CLOSED, potentially marks Inactive).
# - Handles unwritable output directory.
# **Validation Environment:** Primarily tested on Debian/Ubuntu Linux.
# **Automation:** Static analysis performed using ShellCheck.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# FUTURE ROADMAP / POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
# =========================================================================================
# - [Feature]: Add command-line options to specify input file, output directory, ports to scan, and sleep duration.
# - [Feature]: Add option for different nmap scan types (e.g., `-sS` SYN scan, UDP scans - warning: requires root and different parsing).
# - [Feature]: Implement logging to a dedicated file (configurable via option).
# - [Improvement]: More sophisticated IP address validation.
# - [Improvement]: Handle nmap's 'filtered' state distinctly from 'closed'.
# - [Improvement]: Allow specifying hostnames in the input file (would require removing `-n` from nmap).
# - [Refactoring]: Further modularize the port checking and reporting logic.
# - [Compatibility]: Test and adjust for macOS/BSD environments.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - **Privilege Level:** `nmap -sT` may require root/sudo. Running as root should be minimized. The script itself does not inherently need root beyond potential nmap requirements.
# - **Input Sanitization:** Reads IPs from `list_server_ip.txt`. Basic regex validation (`^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$`) is performed, and invalid lines are skipped with a warning. Whitespace is trimmed. Does not protect against carefully crafted malicious input if the script logic were different, but safe for current use where IPs are passed directly to `nmap`.
# - **Sensitive Data Handling:** The input file `list_server_ip.txt` contains target IP addresses, which can be considered sensitive network information. Ensure the file has appropriate read permissions (e.g., 600 or 640). The output CSV files also contain this information and port status; manage their permissions accordingly. No passwords or API keys are handled.
# - **Dependencies:** Relies on standard system tools (`nmap`, `coreutils`, etc.). Ensure these are obtained from trusted sources and kept updated.
# - **File Permissions:** Output files are created with default permissions based on the system's umask. The script modifies `list_server_ip.txt` in place. Consider setting a specific umask before running or using `chmod` afterwards if stricter permissions are needed.
# - **External Command Execution:** Executes `nmap` and `sort`. Input (IP addresses) is passed as arguments to these commands. Standard quoting is used. The risk of command injection is low given the input validation and direct passing of IPs, but always be cautious when executing external commands.
# - **Network Exposure:** Makes outbound TCP connections to specified ports on target IPs. Does not listen on any ports. Ensure scans are authorized.
# - **Code Integrity:** Verify script source if obtained externally (e.g., via checksums).
# - **Error Message Verbosity:** Error messages aim to be informative but generally avoid leaking overly sensitive system details beyond IP addresses and ports being scanned.

Usage: ${SCRIPT_NAME}

Description:
  Checks common open ports (currently: ${COMMON_PORTS[*]}) on servers listed in '${IP_LIST_DEFAULT}'.
  Generates a detailed CSV report ('server_check_results_*.csv') and a summary CSV report ('server_check_summary_*.csv').

Options:
  -h          Display this help message and exit.

Requirements:
  - nmap: Must be installed and in PATH.
  - sort: Must be installed and in PATH (part of coreutils).
  - date: Must be installed and in PATH (part of coreutils).
  - File '${IP_LIST_DEFAULT}' must exist in the script directory and contain one IP address per line.
