# =========================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# =========================================================================================
# This script checks all storage devices (HDD or SSD) on the server and attempts
# to measure the read and write speed using the `dd` command where possible.
# It identifies the device type (HDD/SSD) by checking the rotational flag in sysfs.
# If all existing mount points for a device are unsuitable (e.g., read-only, insufficient space),
# the script will attempt to create a temporary directory, mount the device directly,
# perform the tests, and then clean up the temporary mount.
# The results, including device name, type, write speed, and read speed,
# are saved to a CSV file with a timestamp in its name. Errors and execution details
# are logged to a separate file (`storage_check_errors.log`).
#
# Key Functions:
# - Detect block storage devices using `lsblk`.
# - Determine device type (HDD/SSD) via `/sys/block/<device>/queue/rotational`. # Corrected path
# - Check for required command-line tools (`lsblk`, `dd`, `grep`, `awk`, `mount`, etc.) and attempt installation via `apt-get` if missing.
# - Check for sufficient permissions (requires root/sudo).
# - Identify suitable writable mount points with sufficient space for testing (checks device and partition mounts).
# - If needed, create a temporary mount point (e.g., `/mnt/temp_<device>_<PID>`) for testing. # Updated path example
# - Perform write speed test using `dd` with `if=/dev/zero` and `oflag=direct`.
# - Perform read speed test using `dd` with `of=/dev/null` and `iflag=direct`.
# - Clean up temporary test files (`.testfile_storage_speed_<PID>`) and mount points. # Updated file example
# - Log execution progress and errors to `storage_check_errors.log` (configurable via LOG_FILE variable).
# - Output results to a timestamped CSV file (e.g., `storage_speed_report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv`).

# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =========================================================================================
# - **Automation:** Aims to automatically test all relevant block devices found.
# - **Robustness:** Includes checks for root permissions, required dependencies, mount point writability, and available space. Uses logging for diagnostics. Implements `set -euo pipefail`.
# - **Flexibility:** Attempts temporary mounting if existing mount points are unsuitable. Checks device and partition mounts.
# - **Clarity:** Outputs results clearly to both console (with colors if interactive) and a structured CSV file. Uses verbose logging.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PRIMARY AUDIENCE
# =========================================================================================
# - System Administrators
# - DevOps Engineers
# - IT Support Teams
# - Performance Analysts
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# USAGE
# =========================================================================================
# **Permissions:**
# - Script execution: `chmod +x check_storage_speed.sh`
# - Requires root/sudo privileges for mounting devices, potentially installing packages (`apt-get`), accessing sysfs, and potentially writing to `/mnt`.
#
# **Basic Syntax:**
# `sudo ./check_storage_speed.sh`
#
# **Options:**
# - None currently implemented via command-line flags. Configuration via internal variables (LOG_DIR, REPORT_DIR, DD parameters).
#
# **Arguments:**
# - None.
#
# **Common Examples:**
# 1. Basic execution:
#    `sudo ./check_storage_speed.sh`
#
# **Advanced Execution (e.g., Cron or Systemd):**
# - Example cron job running weekly Sunday at 2 AM:
#   `0 2 * * 0 /path/to/check_storage_speed.sh > /var/log/storage_speed_check.cron.log 2>&1`
#   (Ensure the script path is correct, `sudo` is handled if needed, and cron environment has necessary permissions/PATH).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# INSTALLATION / DEPLOYMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Recommended Location:**
# - Place the script in a standard administrative directory, e.g., `/usr/local/sbin/` or `/opt/scripts/`.
#
# **Manual Setup:**
# 1. Place the script in the chosen location.
# 2. Set ownership if needed (e.g., `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/check_storage_speed.sh`).
# 3. Make the script executable (`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/check_storage_speed.sh`).
# 4. Ensure all dependencies are met (see below). Script attempts auto-install via `apt-get`.
# 5. Run manually with `sudo`.
#
# **Integration:**
# - **Cron Job:** Configure a cron job for scheduled execution. Ensure correct path and permissions. Redirect output appropriately.
# - **Systemd Service/Timer:** Can be integrated for more complex scheduling or dependency management.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Required Interpreter:**
# - `/bin/bash`: The Bourne-Again SHell interpreter.
#
# **Required System Binaries/Tools:**
# - `lsblk`: To list block devices and their mount points. (Package: `util-linux`)
# - `dd`: To measure read/write speed. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `grep`: For pattern searching (uses `-P` for Perl regex). (Package: `grep`)
# - `awk`: For text processing (parsing `df` output). (Package: `gawk` preferred)
# - `mount`: To mount devices temporarily. (Package: `util-linux`)
# - `umount`: To unmount temporary mounts. (Package: `util-linux`)
# - `mkdir`: To create temporary mount directories. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `rmdir`: To remove temporary mount directories. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `touch`: To test writability. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `rm`: To remove test files. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `df`: To check available disk space. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `cat`: To read device type information from sysfs. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `date`: For timestamping logs and output files. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `basename`: Used internally for SCRIPT_NAME. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `dirname`: Used internally for SCRIPT_DIR. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `sort`: Used internally for sorting mount points. (Package: `coreutils`)
# - `sed`: Used internally for parsing `df` output. (Package: `sed` or part of `coreutils`)
# - `command`: Bash built-in.
# - `sudo` (if not run as root): Used internally for `apt-get` operations.
# - `apt-get` (Optional, for auto-install): Package manager used if dependencies are missing on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
#
# **Setup Instructions (if needed):**
# - The script attempts to install missing tools using `sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends <package(s)>` on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
# - On other distributions (e.g., RHEL/CentOS/Fedora), install dependencies manually using `yum` or `dnf`:
#   `sudo yum install util-linux coreutils grep gawk mount procps-ng sed` (adjust package names as needed).
# - Check tool availability: `command -v lsblk && command -v dd && ...`
#
# **Operating System Compatibility:**
# - Designed primarily for Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) due to `apt-get` usage for dependency installation.
# - Should work on most Linux systems with the required tools installed and standard `/sysfs` structure for device type detection. Adjust `check_and_install_requirements` function if needed for other package managers.
#
# **Environment Variables Used:**
# - `EUID`: Checked for root permissions.
# - `BASH_SOURCE`: Used to determine script path.
# - Standard variables like `PATH`.
#
# **System Resource Requirements:**
# - CPU/Memory: Generally low, but `dd` can consume significant CPU and I/O resources during tests, potentially impacting system performance.
# - Disk Space: Requires ~1GB (configurable via `DD_COUNT`/`DD_BLOCK_SIZE` constants) of free space on each successfully tested filesystem for the temporary test file. Requires minimal space for the script, log, and report files.
# - Disk I/O: High during `dd` tests.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# LOGGING MECHANISM
# =========================================================================================
# **Log Destination(s):**
# - Dedicated Log File: Yes. Path defined by `LOG_FILE` variable (Default: `./storage_check_errors.log`).
# - Standard Output (stdout): General progress messages, final summary, results per device (uses colors if interactive).
# - Standard Error (stderr): Error messages, warnings (uses colors if interactive).
#
# **Log Format:**
# - File Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] - Message`
# - Stdout/Stderr Format: Similar, but with ANSI colors if interactive.
#
# **Log Levels Implemented:**
# - `DEBUG`: Detailed internal steps (not shown by default).
# - `INFO`: General operational messages, start/stop, main steps.
# - `WARN`: Potential issues, non-critical errors (e.g., cannot write to mount point, insufficient space).
# - `ERROR`: Significant errors impacting a specific device test or setup (e.g., mount failure, dd failure, dependency missing).
# - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors causing script termination (e.g., permissions error, cannot create report file).
#
# **Log Control:**
# - Logging to file enabled by default (`LOG_TO_FILE=true`).
# - Log file path configured via `LOG_FILE` variable.
# - Verbosity not controlled by command-line flag in this version; DEBUG messages are logged to file but not usually shown on console.
#
# **Log Rotation:**
# - Not handled by the script. Use external tools like `logrotate`.
# - Example `logrotate` config (`/etc/logrotate.d/check_storage_speed`):
#   ```
#   /path/to/storage_check_errors.log {
#       weekly
#       rotate 4
#       compress
#       delaycompress
#       missingok
#       notifempty
#       create 0640 root adm # Adjust path and permissions as needed
#   }
#   ```
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =========================================================================================
# **Standard Output (stdout):**
# - Progress messages indicating which device is being processed.
# - Per-device results summary (e.g., "Device: /dev/sda | Storage Type: SSD | Speeds (Write,Read): 450.1 MB/s,480.2 MB/s").
# - Final summary message indicating completion and paths to report/log files.
#
# **Standard Error (stderr):**
# - Initial permission error message if not run as root.
# - Warnings (e.g., "Mount point ... not writable", "Insufficient space...", "Failed to unmount...").
# - Error messages (e.g., "Failed to mount...", "Failed to measure write speed...").
# - Critical error messages before exit.
# - Output uses ANSI colors if terminal is interactive and NO_COLOR is false.
#
# **Generated/Modified Files:**
# - Report File: Timestamped CSV file (e.g., `storage_speed_report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv`). Path defined by `REPORT_FILE`.
#   - Columns: `Device,Storage Type,Write Speed,Read Speed`. Contains "N/A" if tests failed.
# - Log File: Detailed execution log (e.g., `storage_check_errors.log`). Path defined by `LOG_FILE`.
# - Temporary Test File: Hidden file created on tested mount point (e.g., `/mnt/temp_sda_12345/.testfile_storage_speed_12345`). Deleted after test.
# - Temporary Mount Directory: Created in `/mnt/` if temporary mounting is needed (e.g., `/mnt/temp_sda_12345`). Removed after test (if unmount succeeds).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ERROR HANDLING & CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# **Exit Codes:**
# - 0: Success (script completed execution, report generated).
# - 1: General/Unspecified Error (often triggered by `set -e`) or Specific Error (e.g., insufficient permissions, dependency install failure, critical mount failure, cannot create report). Individual device test failures log errors and report "N/A" but don't typically cause non-zero exit unless no devices could be tested or a critical setup step failed.
#
# **Potential Issues & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Issue:** "Error: This script requires root privileges..."
#   **Resolution:** Run using `sudo ./check_storage_speed.sh`.
# - **Issue:** "CRITICAL ... Required command '...' not found." or "ERROR: 'apt-get' not found..."
#   **Resolution:** Manually install the missing tool(s) using the system's package manager (see DEPENDENCIES). Verify `$PATH`.
# - **Issue:** "N/A" speeds reported for a device.
#   **Resolution:** Check the log file (`storage_check_errors.log`). Common causes:
#     - No writable mount points found for the device or its partitions.
#     - Insufficient free space (<1GB default) on tested mount points.
#     - `dd` command failed (check log for `dd` output).
#     - Temporary mount attempt failed (check log for `mount` errors, verify filesystem on device using `lsblk -f`).
#     - Device is inherently read-only (e.g., CD-ROM reported as block device).
# - **Issue:** Incorrect device type (HDD/SSD/Unknown) reported.
#   **Resolution:** Verify `/sys/block/<device>/queue/rotational`. Some virtualized, USB, or RAID controllers might not report this accurately.
# - **Issue:** Script hangs or takes excessively long.
#   **Resolution:** `dd` tests on large/slow drives take time (proportional to `DD_COUNT`). Monitor system I/O (`iostat`, `iotop`). Check for underlying storage issues (`dmesg`, `smartctl`). Consider reducing `DD_COUNT` if necessary.
# - **Issue:** "Failed to unmount..." or "Failed to remove temporary directory...".
#   **Resolution:** Check log file. The mount point might still be busy (`lsof | grep /mnt/temp...`). Manual cleanup (`sudo umount /mnt/...`, `sudo rmdir /mnt/...`) might be needed.
#
# **Important Considerations / Warnings:**
# - **Requires Root:** Essential for mounting, package installation, sysfs access.
# - **Performance Impact:** `dd` tests generate significant I/O load. Run during low-usage periods on production systems.
# - **Test File Size:** Creates a ~1GB file by default. Ensure sufficient free space exists on filesystems being tested.
# - **Benchmark Accuracy:** `dd` provides a basic sequential I/O benchmark. Results are indicative and can vary based on load, filesystem, caching (though `direct` flags mitigate this), etc. Not a substitute for comprehensive storage benchmarking tools (like `fio`).
# - **Temporary Mounts:** Assumes the device contains a filesystem mountable by the kernel without specific options. May fail on devices without filesystems or with exotic types.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ASSUMPTIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - Running on a Linux system with `bash`.
# - Standard core utilities and required tools are available or installable via `apt-get` (or manually).
# - `/sysfs` provides device rotational status at the standard path.
# - Executed with `root` privileges (`EUID=0`).
# - `/mnt/` directory exists and is writable by root for creating temporary mount points.
# - Block devices listed by `lsblk -dno NAME` are the primary targets for testing. Associated partition mount points are also considered.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - **Privilege Level:** Requires `root`. Necessary for core functions. Run with `sudo`.
# - **Input Sanitization:** Device names obtained from `lsblk` are used in paths/commands. Assumes `lsblk` output is safe. Mount points from `lsblk` are also used. Temporary file/directory names include PID for uniqueness.
# - **Sensitive Data Handling:** Does not handle passwords or API keys.
# - **Dependencies:** Relies on standard system tools. `apt-get` usage assumes trusted repositories.
# - **File Permissions:** Log/Report files created likely as root:root (default umask). Temporary dirs/files created as root. Consider `umask` if specific permissions are needed.
# - **External Command Execution:** Executes system commands (`lsblk`, `dd`, `mount`, `apt-get`, etc.). Commands are generally static or use variables derived from trusted system sources (`lsblk`). `sudo apt-get install` involves running external package manager commands.
# - **Resource Usage:** High I/O during `dd`. Run responsibly.
# - **Code Integrity:** Verify script source if obtained externally (e.g., `sha256sum`).
