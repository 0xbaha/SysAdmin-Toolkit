# =========================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# =========================================================================================
# This script provides a mechanism to reset the home directories of regular users located
# within the /home directory. It iterates through each entry in /home, identifies directories
# corresponding to regular users (typically UID >= 1000), forcefully removes their contents,
# recreates the home directory with strict permissions (700), sets correct ownership,
# and optionally restores a basic set of standard subdirectories (e.g., Desktop, Downloads, Documents).
#
# The primary use case is environments requiring a consistent, clean user state after
# each session or reboot, akin to a "Deep Freeze" setup, often found in computer labs,
# kiosks, or public access computers. It ensures that user-generated data and settings
# from a previous session are wiped clean before the next session begins.
#
# Key Workflow:
# - Iterates through all items in `/home/*`.
# - Checks if an item is a directory.
# - Extracts the directory name as a potential username.
# - Retrieves the UID for the username using the `id` command.
# - Skips the entry if UID lookup fails or if the UID is below `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD` (default 1000).
# - Forcefully removes the user's home directory (`rm -rf`).
# - Recreates the home directory (`mkdir`).
# - Sets ownership to the user and their primary group (`chown user:user`).
# - Sets permissions to owner-only access (`chmod 700`).
# - Optionally creates standard subdirectories (Desktop, Downloads, etc.) and sets their ownership.
#
# !! EXTREME CAUTION !! This script performs destructive actions (`rm -rf`) and will
# permanently delete all data within the targeted user home directories without prompting
# for confirmation. Ensure backups are in place and the script's logic, scope, and
# configuration (like MIN_UID_THRESHOLD) are fully understood before deployment.
# Test thoroughly in a non-production environment.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =========================================================================================
# - **Targeted Reset**: Focuses only on regular user accounts (UID >= `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`),
#   avoiding critical system accounts or accounts below the threshold whose home directories
#   might reside elsewhere or should not be touched.
# - **Security Focused**: Recreates home directories with restrictive permissions (700 - owner only),
#   ensuring privacy between users. Assumes a user-private group scheme (UPG).
# - **Robustness**: Includes checks to only process actual directories within `/home`. Uses `set -euo pipefail`
#   for stricter error handling. Logs actions and errors via the `log_message` function.
# - **Simplicity**: Aims for straightforward logic using standard Unix commands for easier
#   understanding, modification, and maintenance. Avoids complex external dependencies.
# - **Automation**: Designed for unattended execution, typically via system startup (systemd) or
#   shutdown hooks, requiring no user interaction.
# - **Configurability**: Key parameters like `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD` and `CREATE_STANDARD_DIRS` are
#   defined as variables near the top for easy adjustment.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PRIMARY AUDIENCE
# =========================================================================================
# - System Administrators managing Linux labs, public workstations, kiosks, or multi-user environments
#   where periodic user home directory resets are required for security, privacy, or consistency.
# - IT Support Teams deploying standardized desktop environments that need stateless user sessions.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# USAGE
# =========================================================================================
# **Permissions:**
# - Script execution: `chmod +x reset_homes.sh` (or `chmod 700 reset_homes.sh`)
# - File system access: Read/write access within `/home`, ability to create/delete directories.
# - Elevated privileges: Requires `root` privileges (run via `sudo`) due to file ownership changes (`chown`),
#   permissions modifications (`chmod`), and unrestricted deletion (`rm -rf`) within `/home`.
#   Root privileges are validated at the start of the script.
#
# **Basic Syntax:**
#   The script takes no command-line options or arguments. Configuration is done via internal variables.
#   `sudo /path/to/reset_homes.sh`
#
# **Options:**
#   None. Script configuration is managed via variables within the script file itself:
#   - `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`: Set the minimum UID to consider for reset (Default: 1000).
#   - `CREATE_STANDARD_DIRS`: Set to `true` or `false` to control creation of standard subdirs (Default: `true`).
#   - `LOG_LEVEL`: Control verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) (Default: "INFO").
#   - `LOG_TO_FILE`: Set to `true` and define `LOG_FILE` path to enable file logging.
#   - `VERBOSE`: Set to `true` for detailed output (equivalent to `LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"`).
#
# **Arguments:**
#   None.
#
# **Common Examples:**
# 1. Direct execution with sudo (using internal defaults):
#    `sudo ./reset_homes.sh`
#
# 2. Execution from a specific path:
#    `sudo /usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh`
#
# 3. Running with debug logging redirected to a file for troubleshooting:
#    (Modify `LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"` and potentially `LOG_TO_FILE=true`, `LOG_FILE="/var/log/reset_homes.log"` inside the script)
#    `sudo ./reset_homes.sh`
#    Or without modifying script, redirect all output:
#    `sudo ./reset_homes.sh > /var/log/reset_homes_stdout.log 2> /var/log/reset_homes_stderr.log`
#
# **Advanced Execution (Automation):**
# - **Systemd Service:** Create a service unit (e.g., `reset-homes.service`) to run the
#   script during the boot process (e.g., `After=local-fs.target`, `RequiresMountsFor=/home`, `Before=systemd-user-sessions.service`).
#   See INSTALLATION section for an example unit.
# - **Cron Job:** Can be scheduled with `@reboot` in the root user's crontab, though systemd
#   is generally preferred for boot-time tasks for better dependency management.
#   `@reboot /usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh >> /var/log/reset_homes.log 2>&1`
#
# **WARNING:** Test thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying, especially
# when automating execution. Incorrect usage, misconfiguration, or modification can lead to
# significant, irreversible data loss.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# INSTALLATION / DEPLOYMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Recommended Location:**
# - System-wide scripts (requiring root): `/usr/local/sbin/` (preferred for admin scripts).
#
# **Manual Setup:**
# 1. Place the script in the chosen location (e.g., `/usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh`).
# 2. Set appropriate ownership: `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh`
# 3. Set secure executable permissions: `sudo chmod 700 /usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh` (owner read/write/execute only).
# 4. Verify required dependencies are installed (see DEPENDENCIES section - usually standard).
# 5. Review and adjust internal configuration variables (`MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`, etc.) as needed.
# 6. Perform a test run manually in a safe environment: `sudo /usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh`.
# 7. If using file logging, ensure the log directory exists and has appropriate permissions, or that the script can create it.
#
# **Integration (Example: Systemd Service):**
# - Create a unit file, e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/reset-homes.service`:
#   ```
#   [Unit]
#   Description=Reset User Home Directories at Boot
#   Documentation=man:reset_homes.sh # Assuming you create a man page or refer back to script
#   DefaultDependencies=no
#   RequiresMountsFor=/home
#   After=local-fs.target
#   Before=systemd-user-sessions.service getty.target graphical.target shutdown.target # Ensure it runs before user sessions start
# [Service]
#   Type=oneshot
# Specify User and Group if not running as root, though root is required by script logic
# User=root
# Group=root
#   ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/reset_homes.sh
#   RemainAfterExit=yes # Useful for oneshot services that establish a state
#   StandardOutput=journal # Log stdout to journald
#   StandardError=journal # Log stderr to journald
# [Install]
#   WantedBy=multi-user.target # Or adjust depending on when it should run (e.g., before graphical login)
#   ```
# - Reload systemd: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
# - Enable the service to run on boot: `sudo systemctl enable reset-homes.service`
# - Start the service immediately (for testing): `sudo systemctl start reset-homes.service`
# - Check status/logs: `sudo systemctl status reset-homes.service`, `sudo journalctl -u reset-homes.service`
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Required Interpreter:**
# - `/bin/bash`: The Bourne-Again SHell interpreter (Version >= 4.x recommended for features like `declare -A`). Uses bashisms (`set -euo pipefail`, `[[ ]]`, etc.).
#
# **Required System Binaries/Tools:**
# - `coreutils`: Provides fundamental tools used: `basename`, `id`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `chown`, `chmod`, `date`, `echo`, `dirname`, `cd`, `pwd`, `tr`.
# - `command`: Bash built-in used for checking command existence.
# - `sed`: Used within `log_message` function (optional config loading placeholder uses it too).
#
# **Setup Instructions:**
# - These utilities are standard components of virtually all modern Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Arch, etc.). No special installation steps are typically required.
# - Check availability (optional): `command -v id`, `command -v rm`, etc.
#
# **Operating System Compatibility:**
# - Designed primarily for: Linux distributions using a standard `/home/<username>` structure and POSIX utilities.
# - Known compatibility issues: May require adjustments for macOS (different `sed`/`id` flags potentially) or highly non-standard Linux setups. Not designed for Windows.
# - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): Likely works on WSL2 if the Linux distribution meets requirements.
#
# **Environment Variables Used:**
# - `NO_COLOR`: If set (e.g., `export NO_COLOR=true`), disables colored output in logs.
# - `PATH`: Standard variable; ensures required binaries (`id`, `rm`, etc.) are locatable. Script uses standard paths, should not normally be an issue.
# - Does not rely on custom environment variables for configuration.
#
# **System Resource Requirements:**
# - CPU: Minimal. Primarily short bursts for file system operations.
# - Memory: Minimal. Bash script overhead is low.
# - Disk I/O: Can be significant during the `rm -rf` phase if user directories are large. Generally fast for typical reset scenarios (deleting and creating mostly empty directories).
# - Disk Space: Requires negligible space for the script itself. Log file space depends on verbosity and frequency of execution.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# LOGGING MECHANISM
# =========================================================================================
# **Log Destination(s):**
# - Standard Output (stdout): Used for INFO and DEBUG level messages by default.
# - Standard Error (stderr): Used for WARN, ERROR, and CRITICAL level messages. Also used for `set -x` output if enabled.
# - Dedicated Log File: Optional. Controlled by `LOG_TO_FILE=true` and `LOG_FILE="/path/to/log"`. If enabled, messages (without color codes) are appended to this file.
# - System Log (syslog/journald): Not directly implemented, but can be achieved by:
#     - Running via systemd with `StandardOutput=journal` `StandardError=journal` (see INSTALLATION example).
#     - Piping output to `logger`: `sudo ./reset_homes.sh | logger -t reset_homes`
#     - Modifying `log_message` to use `logger` command internally.
#
# **Log Format (Default stdout/stderr/file):**
# `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ZONE] [LEVEL] [script_name.sh:LINE_NUMBER] - Message`
# Example: `[2025-04-20 18:00:00 WIB] [INFO] [reset_homes.sh:350] - Starting home directory reset process...`
#
# **Log Levels:**
# - `DEBUG`: Very detailed step-by-step information (e.g., "Processing entry X", "Executing command Y"). Enabled if `LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"` or `VERBOSE=true`.
# - `INFO`: General operational messages (start/stop, user being reset, completion). Default level.
# - `WARN`: Potential issues or non-critical errors (e.g., failed to get UID for a directory, failed to create optional subdir).
# - `ERROR`: Significant errors likely preventing reset for a specific user (e.g., `mkdir`/`chown`/`chmod` failed after `rm`). Script continues to next user.
# - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors causing script termination (e.g., running without root, `/home` missing, `rm -rf` fails).
# - Control: Set the `LOG_LEVEL` variable inside the script. Only messages at this level or higher are shown/logged.
#
# **Log Rotation (if using a dedicated file):**
# - Handled by script?: No.
# - External Recommendation: Use standard system tools like `logrotate`. Create a config file in `/etc/logrotate.d/reset_homes` to manage rotation (daily/weekly, size, compression, retention).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =========================================================================================
# **Standard Output (stdout):**
# - Normal Operation (`LOG_LEVEL="INFO"`): Prints INFO messages (start, finish, user being reset).
# - Verbose/Debug Operation (`LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"`): Prints INFO and DEBUG messages (detailed steps, commands being run).
#
# **Standard Error (stderr):**
# - Errors: Prints WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL messages.
# - Debug Mode (`set -x`): If uncommented, prints every command executed, prefixed with `+`.
#
# **Generated/Modified Files:**
# - **Primary Effect:** The script fundamentally alters the contents of the `/home` directory by:
#     - **DELETING** contents of user home directories matching the criteria.
#     - **RECREATING** these home directories as empty.
#     - **MODIFYING** ownership (`chown`) and permissions (`chmod`) of these directories.
#     - Optionally **CREATING** standard subdirectories (Desktop, Downloads, etc.) within each reset home directory.
# - Log File: If `LOG_TO_FILE=true`, appends logs to the path specified in `LOG_FILE`.
# - Temporary Files: None used by default.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ERROR HANDLING & CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# **Exit Codes:**
# - 0: Success - Script completed its loop. Note: Errors resetting *individual* users (logged as ERROR/WARN) may occur, but the script will still exit 0 if it finishes the loop.
# - 1: General/Critical Error - Typically corresponds to CRITICAL log messages (e.g., not root, `/home` missing, `rm -rf` failure). The script terminates immediately via `log_message "CRITICAL"` or `set -e`.
# - Other non-zero: Could occur if a command fails unexpectedly and `set -e` triggers exit before specific logging.
#
# **Potential Issues & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Issue:** Home directory not reset for a specific user.
#   **Resolution:** Enable DEBUG logging (`LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"` or `VERBOSE=true`). Check logs for messages about skipping the user (UID below threshold? Not a directory? `id -u` failed?). Verify the user's UID (`id -u <username>`) against `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`. Ensure their home is directly under `/home`.
# - **Issue:** Errors logged related to `rm`, `mkdir`, `chown`, or `chmod`.
#   **Resolution:** Confirm the script is running as root (`log_message "CRITICAL"` checks this early). Check filesystem health (`dmesg`, `fsck`). Ensure `/home` is mounted read-write. Verify the username extracted corresponds to a valid system user/group (for `chown`). Check for immutable flags (`lsattr`).
# - **Issue:** System accounts (UID < 1000) are being processed unexpectedly.
#   **Resolution:** Verify the `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD` variable in the script. Check its value against your system's convention (usually defined in `/etc/login.defs` as `UID_MIN`). Adjust the variable if necessary.
# - **Issue:** Script fails silently when run via cron or systemd.
#   **Resolution:** Check system logs (`journalctl -u <service_name>` for systemd, or cron logs in `/var/log/syslog` or similar). Ensure the execution environment has necessary PATH. Use full paths to commands within the script if needed (though standard paths are generally fine). Redirect output explicitly in cron if not using systemd logging (`>> /var/log/reset_homes.log 2>&1`).
#
# **Important Considerations / Warnings:**
# - **DATA DESTRUCTION**: **CRITICAL:** The `rm -rf` command is irreversible and bypasses any trash mechanism. **ALL DATA** in the targeted home directories (`/home/<user>/*`) **WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST.** This is the script's primary function but carries extreme risk if misconfigured or run accidentally.
# - **BACKUPS**: **ESSENTIAL:** Implement and verify a robust backup strategy for all data within `/home` *before* deploying this script. This script provides *no* recovery capability. Data loss due to misconfiguration is a real possibility.
# - **UID THRESHOLD**: The default `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD=1000` assumes standard Linux user UID allocation. **Verify** this against your system's `/etc/login.defs` (`UID_MIN`) and adjust the script variable if your regular users start at a different UID (e.g., 500 on older systems).
# - **EXCLUSIONS**: The script resets *all* user directories found in `/home` with a UID >= `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`. It **does not** automatically exclude specific users (e.g., an administrative user whose home is in `/home` and has UID >= 1000). Manual exclusions must be added to the loop logic if needed (e.g., `if [[ "$username" == "admin_user_to_keep" ]]; then log_message "INFO" "Skipping explicitly excluded user: $username"; continue; fi`).
# - **NFS/REMOTE HOMES**: This script is designed for local filesystems. Running it on `/home` directories mounted via NFS, Samba/CIFS, etc., may be **unsafe or ineffective**. Filesystem operations could be slow, permissions handling complex, and `rm -rf` might have unintended consequences on the remote server or cause partial failures. Test with extreme caution in such environments, or avoid using it.
# - **ERROR HANDLING ROBUSTNESS**: Uses `set -euo pipefail` and logs errors. If `rm -rf` fails critically, the script exits. If `mkdir/chown/chmod` fail for a user, an ERROR is logged, and the script continues to the next user, potentially leaving that specific user's home in an inconsistent state (e.g., missing, wrong permissions). For higher assurance, more sophisticated transactionality/rollback logic would be needed, significantly increasing complexity.
# - **IDEMPOTENCY**: Running the script multiple times is technically idempotent in the sense that the *end state* (empty home dirs with correct perms) is the same. However, it performs destructive `rm -rf` actions each time, which is unnecessary work and potentially risky if run concurrently or interrupted. It's designed to be run once per desired reset cycle (e.g., once on boot).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ASSUMPTIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - User home directories targeted for reset reside directly under the `/home` directory (e.g., `/home/user1`, `/home/user2`). Does not search recursively or handle other locations like `/var/home`.
# - The script is executed with `root` privileges.
# - Regular user accounts intended for reset have UIDs greater than or equal to `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`.
# - A User Private Group (UPG) scheme is generally in use, where each user's primary group has the same name as the username (relevant for `chown "$username:$username"`). If not, `chown` might need adjustment.
# - The underlying filesystem for `/home` is a standard Linux filesystem (ext4, xfs, btrfs, etc.) supporting POSIX permissions and ownership.
# - Core Unix utilities (`basename`, `id`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `chown`, `chmod`, `date`, etc.) are available in the system's `$PATH` and function as expected on a POSIX-compliant system.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Optional)
# =========================================================================================
# **Benchmarks:** Not formally benchmarked. Performance primarily depends on disk I/O speed and the number/size of directories being deleted.
# **Resource Consumption Profile:** Generally low CPU/memory. Disk I/O is the main factor, potentially high during `rm -rf` on large directories.
# **Optimization Notes:**
# - Uses standard core utilities which are generally efficient.
# - Avoids unnecessary forks where possible (e.g., uses Bash built-ins like `[[ ]]`).
# - The loop processes users sequentially. Parallelization (e.g., using `&` with careful job management or `xargs -P`) could speed up processing on systems with many users and fast I/O, but adds complexity and potential risks if not managed properly. Current sequential approach is simpler and safer.
# - Bottleneck is likely disk I/O during deletion.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# TESTING & VALIDATION (Optional)
# =========================================================================================
# **Test Strategy:** Primarily manual testing in controlled environments (VMs, test servers).
# **Key Test Cases:**
# - Run as non-root (should fail with CRITICAL error).
# - Run on a system with users having UIDs both below and above `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`.
# - Run with non-directory files present in `/home` (should be skipped).
# - Run with directories in `/home` that don't match valid usernames (should be skipped with WARN).
# - Test with `CREATE_STANDARD_DIRS=true` and `false`.
# - Test different `LOG_LEVEL` settings.
# - **CRITICAL:** Test impact on a system with sample user data to confirm deletion occurs as expected.
# - Test integration with chosen automation method (systemd, cron).
# **Validation Tools:**
# - `ShellCheck` (Highly Recommended): Run `shellcheck reset_homes.sh` to catch potential syntax errors, quoting issues, and common pitfalls.
# - Manual inspection of logs and filesystem state after runs.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# FUTURE ROADMAP / POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
# =========================================================================================
# - Add an explicit exclusion list (e.g., read from a config file or array) for usernames/UIDs never to reset.
# - Implement locking (e.g., `flock`) to prevent concurrent runs if deployed in a way that might allow it.
# - Make configuration parameters (Threshold, Dirs) configurable via command-line arguments (`getopts`) or an external config file.
# - Option to copy skeleton files (from `/etc/skel`) into the newly created home directory.
# - More granular error handling: Potentially attempt to continue resetting permissions even if `mkdir` failed (though current logic prevents this), or offer options on failure.
# - Add dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) that logs actions that *would* be taken without actually deleting/modifying anything.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - **Privilege Level:** Requires `root` privileges. This is necessary for `rm -rf /home/*` and `chown`/`chmod`. Grants the script maximum power over user data. **Restrict access to the script file itself** (e.g., `chmod 700`, `chown root:root`).
# - **Input Sanitization:** No direct external input via arguments. Relies on `basename` for username extraction from directory paths found via `/home/*`. While generally safe, extremely unusual directory names with special characters in `/home` could theoretically cause issues, though coreutils are robust. `id -u` is used with the extracted name.
# - **Sensitive Data Handling:** The script's purpose is to **DELETE** data, potentially including sensitive user data. It does not handle passwords or API keys itself. The main security risk is **accidental or malicious execution leading to data loss**.
# - **Dependencies:** Relies on standard, trusted core Unix utilities (`rm`, `mkdir`, `id`, etc.). Keep the OS updated to patch vulnerabilities in these tools.
# - **File Permissions:** Explicitly sets recreated home directories to `700` (owner `rwx`, group/other no access), a secure default. Standard subdirectories get default permissions based on `umask` but are owned by the user.
# - **External Command Execution:** Executes standard utilities (`rm`, `mkdir`, `chown`, `chmod`, `id`, `basename`) with paths derived from `/home/*`. Variables holding paths/usernames are double-quoted (`"$user_home"`, `"$username"`) to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.
# - **Code Integrity:** If obtained from untrusted sources, verify integrity using checksums (e.g., SHA256) against a known good copy. Malicious modification could be catastrophic.
# - **Data Deletion Risk:** **Paramount concern.** Accidental execution, incorrect `MIN_UID_THRESHOLD`, or failure to implement necessary exclusions can lead to **irreversible loss of critical user data.** Careful configuration, thorough testing, and strict access control are mandatory. Use of automation (cron, systemd) requires extra caution.
