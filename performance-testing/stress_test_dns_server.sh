# =========================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# =========================================================================================
# This script automates DNS stress testing by performing randomized,
# high-volume DNS queries on a specified DNS server. The script runs
# in the background, periodically sending DNS queries using `dnsperf`
# at random intervals and for random durations. Each test's detailed results
# and a summary report are saved in timestamped files for review and analysis.
#
# The script is designed to run continuously and persistently in the
# background using `nohup`, ignoring terminal interruptions, until explicitly stopped.
# It includes dependency checking (and installation attempt via `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu),
# robust logging with different levels, and process management via a PID file.
#
# Key Functions:
# - Sets strict Bash mode (`set -euo pipefail`).
# - Checks for and optionally installs required dependencies (`dnsperf`, `bc`) using `apt`.
# - Restarts itself in the background using `nohup` for persistent operation.
# - Manages its background process using a PID file (`dns_stress_test.pid`).
# - Creates a sample query file (`dns_queries.txt`) if one doesn't exist.
# - Runs `dnsperf` against a specified DNS server (`DNS_SERVER`) using queries from `QUERY_FILE`.
# - Executes tests for randomized durations selected from `DURATION_OPTIONS`.
# - Waits for randomized intervals between tests, selected from `INTERVAL_OPTIONS`.
# - Provides structured logging (`log_message` function) with levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).
# - Logs general script activity (start, stop, waits, test completion) to `LOG_FILE` or stdout/stderr.
# - Saves raw `dnsperf` output for each test run to `./results/dns_stress_test_output_TIMESTAMP.txt`.
# - Parses raw output and saves key metrics (QPS, latency, success/loss rates) to `./results/dns_test_summary_TIMESTAMP.txt`.
# - Provides mechanisms to stop (`stop` command) and get help (`help` command).
# - Implements `trap` for cleanup on exit/interrupt.

# =========================================================================================
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =========================================================================================
# - **Automation:** Designed for unattended, continuous background execution.
# - **Robustness:** Includes strict mode, dependency checks, `nohup`, PID file management, and signal trapping for cleanup.
# - **Randomization:** Uses randomized durations and intervals to simulate variable load patterns.
# - **Simplicity:** Focuses on orchestrating `dnsperf` with clear, sequential logic within the main loop.
# - **Logging:** Provides structured, multi-level logging for monitoring and diagnostics.
# - **Modularity:** Uses functions for distinct tasks (logging, dependency checks, test execution, cleanup, etc.).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# PRIMARY AUDIENCE
# =========================================================================================
# - System Administrators
# - Network Engineers
# - DevOps Engineers
# - IT Support Teams performing DNS server load testing or validation.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# USAGE
# =========================================================================================
# **Permissions:**
# - Script execution: `chmod +x stress_test_dns_server.sh`
# - File system access: Requires write permissions in the script's directory (or configured log/output directories) to create log, PID, query (if missing), and result files.
# - Network access: Requires outbound network connectivity to the target `DNS_SERVER` on port 53 (UDP/TCP).
# - Elevated privileges: Requires `sudo` privileges *only* if dependencies (`dnsperf`, `bc`) need to be installed via `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
#
# **Basic Syntax:**
#   `./stress_test_dns_server.sh [COMMAND]`
#
# **Commands:**
#   (no command)   : Starts the script in the background using `nohup`. Logs to configured `LOG_FILE`
#                    (default: `./dns_stress_test.log`). Creates configured `PID_FILE` (default: `./dns_stress_test.pid`).
#   `stop`           : Stops the running background instance identified by the `PID_FILE`.
#   `help`, `--help` : Displays this usage information and exits.
#
# **Internal Options (Not for direct user invocation):**
#   `--no-restart` : Internal flag used when the script restarts itself with `nohup` to prevent looping restarts.
#
# **Configuration:**
# - Primary configuration is done by editing variables within the script's
#   "Global Runtime Variables" section (e.g., `DNS_SERVER`, `QUERY_FILE`, `LOG_FILE`, `PID_FILE`,
#   `DURATION_OPTIONS`, `INTERVAL_OPTIONS`).
#
# **Common Examples:**
# 1. Start the stress test in the background with default settings:
#    `./stress_test_dns_server.sh`
#    (Monitor progress via `tail -f dns_stress_test.log` and check the `./results/` directory)
#
# 2. Stop the running stress test:
#    `./stress_test_dns_server.sh stop`
#
# 3. Get help:
#    `./stress_test_dns_server.sh help`
#
# **Advanced Execution (Automation):**
# - The script is designed for background execution via its internal `nohup` mechanism.
# - Can be managed by process supervisors (like systemd or supervisorctl) if needed, but ensure the `stop` command or manual `kill` using the PID file is used for graceful termination.
# - Example cron job (ensure environment variables like PATH are correctly set):
#   `@reboot /path/to/stress_test_dns_server.sh`
#   (Note: built-in `nohup` provides persistence; cron might be redundant unless specific scheduling is needed)
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# INSTALLATION / DEPLOYMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Recommended Location:**
# - User scripts: `~/bin/` or `~/.local/bin/` (ensure these are in user's $PATH)
# - System-wide scripts: `/usr/local/sbin/` or `/opt/scripts/`
#
# **Manual Setup:**
# 1. Place the script (`stress_test_dns_server.sh`) in the desired location.
# 2. Ensure it has execute permissions: `chmod +x stress_test_dns_server.sh`.
# 3. **Crucially, edit the script** to set the correct `DNS_SERVER` IP address in the configuration section.
# 4. Optionally, customize other configuration variables (`QUERY_FILE`, `LOG_FILE`, `PID_FILE`, `DURATION_OPTIONS`, `INTERVAL_OPTIONS`).
# 5. Optionally, create a custom query file at the location specified by `QUERY_FILE`. If not present, a default one (`./dns_queries.txt`) will be created relative to the script's directory.
# 6. Install dependencies manually if not using Debian/Ubuntu or if automatic installation fails (see DEPENDENCIES section).
# 7. Run the script (`./stress_test_dns_server.sh`) to start it in the background.
#
# **Integration:**
# - Can be started manually or via system startup mechanisms (`@reboot` cron, systemd). Ensure the working directory context is appropriate if run via automation, especially for relative paths like the default `QUERY_FILE`, `LOG_FILE`, `PID_FILE`, and `./results/` directory. Running from the script's own directory is recommended.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT
# =========================================================================================
# **Required Interpreter:**
# - `/bin/bash`: Version >= 4.0 recommended (uses `declare -A`, `pipefail`).
#
# **Required System Binaries/Tools:**
# - `coreutils`: Provides `date`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, `cat`, `basename`, `dirname`, `sleep`, `echo`, `ps`, `kill`, `rm`, `tr`.
# - `dnsperf`: Core tool for performing DNS load testing. (Script attempts `apt install dnsperf` if missing on Debian/Ubuntu).
# - `bc`: Basic calculator utility for floating-point arithmetic (parsing results). (Script attempts `apt install bc` if missing).
# - `grep`: For parsing text output from `dnsperf`.
# - `awk`: For extracting specific fields from text output.
# - `command`: Bash built-in for checking command existence.
# - `nohup`: For running the script persistently in the background.
# - `sudo`: Required *only* for automatic installation attempt of `dnsperf` and `bc` via `apt`.
#
# **Setup Instructions (Dependencies):**
# - The script attempts auto-install using `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu if `dnsperf` or `bc` are missing.
# - Manual installation on Debian/Ubuntu:
#   `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dnsperf bc`
# - Manual installation on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora (package names may vary slightly):
#   `sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install -y bind-utils bc` (or `yum install bind-utils bc`)
# - Manual installation on macOS (using Homebrew):
#   `brew install bind bc` (`dnsperf` is part of `bind`)
#
# **Operating System Compatibility:**
# - Designed primarily for Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu) due to `apt` usage.
# - Should work on other Linux distributions and potentially macOS if dependencies are manually installed and core utilities are present.
#
# **Environment Variables Used:**
# - None directly used for configuration (script uses internal variables).
# - `PATH`: Standard variable; ensure all required binaries are locatable.
#
# **System Resource Requirements:**
# - CPU/Memory: Depends heavily on `dnsperf` intensity (duration, query rate, concurrency - not explicitly controlled here). Can range from low to high. Monitor usage.
# - Disk I/O: Moderate for writing log, raw output, and summary files to the script's directory or configured paths.
# - Network: Can generate significant DNS query traffic towards the target `DNS_SERVER`. Ensure this is acceptable and monitored.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# LOGGING MECHANISM
# =========================================================================================
# **Log Destination(s):**
# - **General Log File:** Configured via `LOG_FILE` variable (default: `./dns_stress_test.log`). Captures script start/stop, dependency checks, test cycle start/wait messages, warnings, and errors. Stdout/stderr of the background process are redirected here via `nohup`.
# - **Raw Output Files:** `./results/dns_stress_test_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`. Contains the full, unmodified standard output from each `dnsperf` run. Created in a `results` subdirectory relative to the script.
# - **Summary Report Files:** `./results/dns_test_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`. Contains key metrics parsed from the raw output for each test run. Created in the `results` subdirectory.
# - **PID File:** Configured via `PID_FILE` variable (default: `./dns_stress_test.pid`). Stores the process ID of the background script instance.
# - **Standard Output/Error (Terminal):** Initial start messages when launching in background, and status messages from the `stop` or `help` commands are printed to the console. Errors during initial launch might also appear.
#
# **Log Format (General Log File / Stdout/Stderr):**
# - `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ] [LEVEL] - Message` (e.g., `[2025-04-20 17:00:00 WIB] [INFO] - Starting main execution loop...`)
# - Colors are used for levels in interactive terminals, stripped for file logging.
#
# **Log Levels:**
# - `DEBUG`: Detailed step-by-step information (e.g., selected duration, command execution details). Enabled via `VERBOSE=true` config.
# - `INFO`: General operational messages (script start/stop, test cycle start/end, waits). Default level.
# - `WARN`: Potential issues or non-critical errors (e.g., stale PID file found, cannot write to log dir, parsing issues).
# - `ERROR`: Significant errors that likely impact functionality (e.g., `dnsperf` command failed, failed to stop process).
# - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors causing immediate script termination (e.g., missing critical dependency after install attempt, unwritable config/output dirs).
#
# **Log Rotation:**
# - Not handled internally. Log files (`LOG_FILE`, `results/*.txt`) will grow over time.
# - Recommend using external tools like `logrotate` for the main `LOG_FILE` if long-term execution is planned.
# - Output/summary files in `./results/` are timestamped; manage manually or via separate cleanup scripts based on age/size/count.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =========================================================================================
# **Standard Output (stdout):**
# - Normal Operation (Background): Primarily directed to `LOG_FILE`. May show initial startup messages if run interactively before daemonizing. Shows INFO/DEBUG messages if `LOG_TO_FILE=false`.
# - `stop` Command: Status messages regarding stopping the process.
# - `help` Command: Usage information.
#
# **Standard Error (stderr):**
# - Normal Operation (Background): Primarily directed to `LOG_FILE`. May show initial startup errors. Shows WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL messages.
# - `stop` Command: Error messages if stopping fails.
# - `help` Command: Usage information (conventionally sent to stderr).
#
# **Generated/Modified Files:**
# - Log File: Path specified by `LOG_FILE` (default: `./dns_stress_test.log`). Appended with operational logs.
# - PID File: Path specified by `PID_FILE` (default: `./dns_stress_test.pid`). Created on start, removed on clean stop/cleanup. Contains PID of the background process.
# - Query File: Path specified by `QUERY_FILE` (default: `./dns_queries.txt`). Created with sample content if it doesn't exist.
# - Raw Output Files: `./results/dns_stress_test_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`. One created per test run. Contains raw `dnsperf` output.
# - Summary Report Files: `./results/dns_test_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`. One created per test run. Contains parsed key metrics.
# - Directories: `./results/` subdirectory is created if it doesn't exist. Log/PID/Query file directories are also created if possible.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ERROR HANDLING & CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# **Exit Codes:**
# - 0: Success (Script started in background successfully, `stop` command completed successfully, `help` displayed).
# - 1: Critical Error (Dependency missing after install attempt, unwritable directories, `kill` failed, invalid arguments via `usage`). Background process might exit with 1 on CRITICAL log events.
# - Non-zero (Implicit): `dnsperf` might exit non-zero (logged as ERROR), `sudo apt` might fail (logged as CRITICAL). Failures due to `set -e`.
#
# **Potential Issues & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Issue:** `dnsperf` or `bc` command not found.
#   **Resolution:** Ensure `sudo apt install dnsperf bc` (or equivalent for your OS) was successful. Check `LOG_FILE` for installation errors. Verify `PATH`.
# - **Issue:** Script doesn't start in background / `nohup` fails / exits immediately.
#   **Resolution:** Check permissions in the script's directory. Check system resources. Check `LOG_FILE` for early CRITICAL errors (e.g., unwritable PID directory).
# - **Issue:** Script stops unexpectedly.
#   **Resolution:** Check `LOG_FILE` for ERROR or CRITICAL messages. Check system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `journalctl`) for external signals or resource issues (OOM killer).
# - **Issue:** `stop` command fails ("PID file not found", "Process with PID not found", "Failed to send kill signal").
#   **Resolution:** Check if `PID_FILE` exists and path is correct. Verify the PID inside exists (`ps aux | grep PID`). The process might have died, the file might be stale (script attempts cleanup), or permissions prevent signaling.
# - **Issue:** High resource usage (CPU, Network).
#   **Resolution:** `dnsperf` is the likely cause. Adjust `DURATION_OPTIONS` / `INTERVAL_OPTIONS` in the script config. Monitor the target `DNS_SERVER`.
# - **Issue:** Permission denied creating files/directories.
#   **Resolution:** Ensure the user running the script has write permissions in the script's directory (for default paths) or the configured `LOG_FILE`, `PID_FILE`, `QUERY_FILE` directories and `./results/`.
#
# **Important Considerations / Warnings:**
# - **Network Load:** This script WILL generate significant DNS query traffic. Use responsibly. Ensure target `DNS_SERVER` can handle the load and that testing is permitted. Monitor network impact.
# - **Resource Usage:** Monitor CPU/memory on the machine running the script.
# - **Continuous Operation:** Runs indefinitely until stopped (`stop` command, `kill`, or system shutdown).
# - **Output Files:** Timestamped files in `./results/` accumulate. Implement a cleanup strategy (manual or automated) if needed.
# - **Idempotency:** Not strictly idempotent. Running `start` when already running (with a valid PID file) will fail. Each test run creates unique output files.
# - **Concurrency:** Designed to run as a single instance, managed by the PID file. No internal locking for multiple concurrent runs.
# - **Rate Limiting:** No rate limiting applied to `dnsperf` by default. High QPS can occur.
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# ASSUMPTIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - Assumes a Bash (v4+) environment with access to standard core utilities.
# - Assumes required dependencies (`dnsperf`, `bc`, etc.) are installed or can be installed via `apt` (on Debian/Ubuntu).
# - Assumes `sudo` is available and configured (potentially passwordless) if dependency installation is needed.
# - Assumes network connectivity to the target `DNS_SERVER`.
# - Assumes write permissions in the script's directory for default file/directory creation.
# - Assumes the script is executed with appropriate user privileges for its actions (file writing, process signaling).
# =========================================================================================

# =========================================================================================
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
# =========================================================================================
# - **Privilege Level:** Requires `sudo` *only* for optional dependency installation via `apt`. Normal operation runs as the executing user. Avoid running the main test loop as root.
# - **Input Sanitization:** Configuration variables (`DNS_SERVER`, file paths) are used directly. Ensure paths are controlled. No direct execution of user-supplied commands. The `stop`/`help` arguments are simple string comparisons.
# - **Sensitive Data Handling:** No passwords or API keys handled. Target DNS server IP is stored in the script configuration.
# - **Dependencies:** Relies on standard system utilities and `dnsperf`/`bc`. Ensure these are from trusted sources/repositories.
# - **File Permissions:** Files/directories (logs, PID, results) are created with default user permissions (`umask`). The PID file might be world-readable. Consider setting a stricter `umask` before running if needed.
# - **External Command Execution:** Executes `dnsperf`, `ps`, `kill`, `apt`. Variables used in commands (like `${DNS_SERVER}`, `${QUERY_FILE}`) should be properly quoted (as implemented) to prevent unexpected word splitting or globbing issues, though the risk is low with typical IP/path values.
# - **Network Exposure:** Makes outbound connections to the target `DNS_SERVER` on port 53. Does not listen on any ports.
# - **Denial of Service Risk:** High potential to overload the target `DNS_SERVER` or intermediate network infrastructure. **Use with extreme caution and only on servers you own or have explicit permission to test.**
# - **Error Message Verbosity:** Error messages logged might contain file paths or PIDs, generally acceptable for this type of tool but avoid leaking sensitive info if modifying.

Usage: ${SCRIPT_NAME} [COMMAND]

Automates DNS stress testing against a specified server.

Commands:
  (no command)   Starts the stress test script in the background using nohup.
                 Logs to ${LOG_FILE}. Creates ${PID_FILE}.
  stop           Stops the running background instance identified by ${PID_FILE}.
  help           Displays this help message and exits.

Configuration (modify variables within the script):
  DNS_SERVER       : Target DNS server IP (${DNS_SERVER})
  QUERY_FILE       : Path to query file (${QUERY_FILE})
  LOG_FILE         : Path to main log file (${LOG_FILE})
  PID_FILE         : Path to PID file (${PID_FILE})
